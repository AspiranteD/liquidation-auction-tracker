# liquidation-auction-tracker

A self-contained pipeline that monitors **Amazon EU liquidation auctions** on
[B-Stock](https://bstock.com/amazoneu/), downloads the lot manifests, runs a
profitability analysis and alerts you by email and/or WhatsApp when an auction
matches your buying criteria.

Built from a real problem: B-Stock liquidation truckloads close fast, the
headline bid hides the true landed cost (transport, VAT, marketplace fee, the
Spanish "recargo de equivalencia"), and there's no way to get notified when a
genuinely profitable lot appears. This tool scrapes the auctions, computes the
**maximum bid** you can afford for a target margin, and alerts you.

> Standalone showcase project. It uses SQLite and has no dependencies beyond the
> public B-Stock site and (optionally) an SMTP account. It does **not** place
> bids — it monitors and advises.

## The bid calculator

The core of the project. Given a lot's retail value and a target landed cost
(as a % of retail), it reverse-solves the cost model to tell you the maximum
bid you can place:

```
total_cost = bid + transport + VAT + bstock_fee + RE

VAT        = (transport + bid) × 21%
bstock_fee = bid × 4%
RE         = total_cost × 5.2%      (recargo de equivalencia)
```

Solving for `bid`:

```
max_bid = (total_cost − transport×1.21 − 0.052×total_cost) / (1 + 0.04 + 0.21)
```

```bash
$ python -m liquidation_tracker.cli bid --retail 16670 --type "Small Truckload" --pct 0.25
Lot type      : Small Truckload
Retail value  : EUR 16,670.00
Target landed : 25% of retail
----------------------------------------
Max bid       : EUR 2,741.38
Transport     : EUR 433.11
VAT (21%)     : EUR 666.64
B-Stock fee   : EUR 109.66
RE (5.2%)     : EUR 216.71
Total landed  : EUR 4,167.50
Bid % retail  : 16.4%
```

Transport is a flat rate per lot type (`Truckload`, `Small Truckload`,
`4 Pallets DE/PL/IT`, …) and is fully configurable.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AspiranteD/liquidation-auction-tracker.git
cd liquidation-auction-tracker
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env        # optional: configure email alerts and thresholds
```

Try it offline (no network) with the bundled sample manifest:

```bash
python examples/demo.py
```

## CLI

```bash
# Compute the max bid for a lot
python -m liquidation_tracker.cli bid --retail 16670 --type "Small Truckload" --pct 0.25

# List active auctions for a country, with suggested bids (live)
python -m liquidation_tracker.cli list --country ES

# Analyze a manifest CSV
python -m liquidation_tracker.cli analyze data/sample_manifest.csv

# Full pipeline: scrape -> evaluate -> store in SQLite -> email key auctions
python -m liquidation_tracker.cli monitor --country ES
```

## Alerts (email + WhatsApp)

Two channels, independently switchable in `.env`:

- **Email**: set the SMTP variables and `EMAIL_ALERTS_ENABLED=true`.
- **WhatsApp** (via the free [CallMeBot](https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-whatsapp-messages/)
  API): add the CallMeBot number on WhatsApp, send it
  `I allow callmebot to send me messages`, copy the apikey it replies with into
  `CALLMEBOT_APIKEY`, set `CALLMEBOT_PHONE` to your number in international
  format and `WHATSAPP_ALERTS_ENABLED=true`.

An auction is considered *key* (and triggers one alert) when it passes every
rule:

| Rule | Env var | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| Country in monitor list | `MONITOR_COUNTRIES` | `ES` |
| Retail ≥ threshold | `ALERT_MIN_RETAIL` | `5000` |
| Current bid still lands ≤ X% of retail | `ALERT_MAX_TOTAL_PCT` | `0.30` |
| Pieces ≥ threshold | `ALERT_MIN_PIECES` | `0` |

The suggested max bid in the alert is computed with `BID_TARGET_TOTAL_PCT`
(default `0.25`). Alerts are de-duplicated: each auction is alerted at most once.

## Storage

SQLite (`data/auctions.db`):

- `auction` — latest state per auction plus the computed suggested bid.
- `bid_snapshot` — append-only log of the current bid each time the auction is
  seen, so you can chart how bids evolve toward close.

## Anti-bot note

B-Stock sits behind Cloudflare. A plain `requests` session with a browser
User-Agent works from most residential IPs (and is what this project uses). If
you hit a challenge page, the network layer (`client.py`) is isolated behind
three methods (`list_auctions`, `fetch_lot_id`, `download_manifest`) so it can
be swapped for a Playwright-backed client without touching the rest of the
pipeline.
